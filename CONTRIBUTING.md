## Development Environment

### Getting the code

Go to https://github.com/karenkgs/ts-template and fork the project repository.

```bash
    # Clone your fork
    git clone git@github.com:<YOU>/ts-template.git

    # Enter the project directory
    cd ts-template

    # Create a branch for your changes
    git checkout -b your_new_branch
```

It's interesting to make sure everything is working fine before you start working on something, so make sure you build the project and run the tests before and after your changes.
